Aurora Engine implements an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) on the NEAR Protocol.
See [doc.aurora.dev](https://doc.aurora.dev/develop/compat/evm) for additional
documentation.

## Deployments

| Network | Contract ID         | Chain ID   |
|---------|---------------------|------------|
| Mainnet | [`aurora`][Mainnet] | 1313161554 |
| Testnet | [`aurora`][Testnet] | 1313161555 |
| Local   | `aurora.test.near`  | 1313161556 |

[Mainnet]: https://explorer.near.org/accounts/aurora
[Testnet]: https://explorer.testnet.near.org/accounts/aurora

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14+)
- cargo-make

```sh
cargo install --force cargo-make
```

### Prerequisites for Development

- Node.js (v14+)
- Docker
- cargo-make

## Development

### Branches

- [`master`] is the current stable branch.
  It must be ready, at all times, to be deployed on chain at a moment's notice.

- [`develop`] is our bleeding-edge development branch.
  In general, kindly target all pull requests to this branch.

### Building & Make Commands

Every task with `cargo make` must have a `--profile` argument.

The current available `profile`s are:
- `mainnet`: suitable for mainnet.
- `mainnet-silo`: silo contract suitable for mainnet.
- `testnet`: suitable for testnet.
- `testnet-silo`: silo contract suitable for testnet.
- `local`: suitable for local development.
- `custom`: suitable for custom environments, see note below.

In some circumstances, you may require a custom environment. This can
be created in the `.env` folder as `custom.env` following the structure of the
other `.env` files. See `bin/local-custom.env` for more details.

Every `make` invocation must follow the following pattern, though `--profile` is
not required in all cases (such as cleanup):

```sh
cargo make [--profile <profile>] <task>
```

#### Building the engine and contracts

There are several commands that can be used to build the binaries. The currently supported parameters
for the `task` field are listed below:

- `default`: does not need to be specified, runs `build`. Requires a `--profile`
  argument.
- `build`: builds all engine smart contract and produces the
  `aurora-<profile>-test.wasm` in the `bin` folder. Requires `build-contracts`. 
  Requires a `--profile` argument.
- `build-test`: builds all the below using test features. Requires a `--profile`
  argument.
- `build-contracts`: builds all the ETH contracts.
- `build-docker`: builds the `aurora-<profile>-test.wasm` in the `bin` folder using docker build environment. The purpose of this task is to produce reproducible binaries.

For example, the following will build the mainnet debug binary:
```sh
cargo make --profile mainnet build
```

#### Verifying binary hash

To verify that a deployed binary matches the source code, you may want to build it reproducibly and then verify that the SHA256 hash matches that of the deployed binary. The motivation behind this is to prevent malicious code from being deployed.

Run these commands to produce the binary hash:
```sh
cargo make --profile <profile> build-docker
shasum -a 256 bin/aurora-<profile>.wasm
```

#### Running unit & integration tests

To run tests, there are a few cargo make tasks we can run:
- `test-workspace`: tests only the cargo workspace.
- `test-contracts`: tests only the contracts.
- `test`: tests the whole cargo workspace, ETH contracts and runs modexp benchmarks. Requires a `--profile` argument.
- `test-flow`: tests the whole cargo workspace and ETH contracts. Requires a `--profile` argument.
- `bench-modexp`: runs modexp benchmarks. Requires a `--profile` argument.

For example, the following will test the whole workspace and ETH contracts:
```sh
cargo make --profile mainnet test 
```

#### Running checks & lints

The following tasks are available to run lints and checks:

- `check`: checks the format, clippy and ETH contracts.
- `check-contracts` runs yarn lints on the ETH contracts.
- `check-fmt`: checks the workspace Rust format only.
- `clippy`: checks the Rust workspace with clippy only.

For example, the following command will run the checks. `profile` is not required
here:
```sh
cargo make check
```

#### Cleanup

The following tasks are available to clean up the workspace:

- `clean`: cleans all built binaries and ETH contracts.
- `clean-cargo`: cleans with cargo.
- `clean-contracts`: cleans the ETH contracts.
- `clean-bin`: cleans the binaries.

Additionally, there is also but not included in the `clean` task:

- `sweep`: sweeps the set amount of days in the ENV, default to 30 days.

For example, the following command will clean everything. `profile` is not 
required:
```sh
cargo make clean
```
