<!--
Thanks for submitting a pull request! Here are some helpful tips:

* Always create branches on and target the `develop` branch.
* Run all the tests locally and ensure that they are passing.
* Run `make format` to ensure that the code is formatted.
* Run `make check` to ensure that all checks passed successfully.
* Small commits and contributions that attempt one single goal is preferable.
* If the idea changes or adds anything functional which will affect users, an 
AIP discussion is required first on the Aurora forum: 
https://forum.aurora.dev/discussions/AIPs%20(Aurora%20Improvement%20Proposals).
* Avoid breaking the public API (namely in engine/src/lib.rs) unless required.
* If your PR is a WIP, ensure that you enable "draft" mode.
* Your first PRs won't use the CI automatically unless a maintainer starts.
If this is not your first PR, please do NOT abuse the CI resources.

## Description

<!-- 
Provide a general summary of your changes. A clear overview along with an 
in-depth explanation is beneficial.

If this PR closes any issues, be sure to add "closes #<number>" somewhere.

## Performance / NEAR gas cost considerations

<!--
Performance regressions are not ideal, though we welcome performance 
improvements. Any PR must be completely mindful of any gas cost increases. The 
CI will fail if the gas costs change at all. Do update these tests to 
accommodate for the new gas changes. It is good to explain 
this change, if necessary.
