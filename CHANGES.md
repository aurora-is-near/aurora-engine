## [2.1.0] - 2021-11-04

### Fixed

- Bug in `ft_transfer_call` and `ft_resolve_transfer` by  [@birchmd] and [@mrLSD]. ([#326](https://github.com/aurora-is-near/aurora-engine/pull/326) [#330](https://github.com/aurora-is-near/aurora-engine/pull/330))
- Incorrect gas cost on ripemd precompile by [@joshuajbouw]. ([#329](https://github.com/aurora-is-near/aurora-engine/pull/329))

## [2.0.2] - 2021-11-01

### Added

- Logging number of storage writes by [@birchmd]. ([#322](https://github.com/aurora-is-near/aurora-engine/pull/322))

### Fixed

- Show full address in logging transaction sender on `submit` by [@birchmd]. ([#321](https://github.com/aurora-is-near/aurora-engine/pull/321))

## [2.0.1] - 2021-11-01

### Added

- Added logging of public keys during `submit` calls by [@joshuajbouw]. ([#319](https://github.com/aurora-is-near/aurora-engine/pull/319))

## [2.0.0] - 2021-10-27

### Added

- Public method for computing Aurora blockhash at a given hight by [@birchmd]. ([#303](https://github.com/aurora-is-near/aurora-engine/pull/303))

### Changed

- EVM logs returned in `SubmitResult` include the address the log originates from by [@birchmd]. ([#299](https://github.com/aurora-is-near/aurora-engine/pull/299))
  - Note: this is a breaking change in the `SubmitResult` binary format.

### Fixed

- Precompile bug fixes by [@birchmd]. ([#305](https://github.com/aurora-is-near/aurora-engine/pull/305), [#306](https://github.com/aurora-is-near/aurora-engine/pull/306))
- Update to latest `rust-blockchain/evm` version (fixes bug in `JUMPI`) EVM opcode by [@birchmd]. ([#316](https://github.com/aurora-is-near/aurora-engine/pull/316))

## [1.7.0] - 2021-10-13

### Changes

- Add EVM events for exit precompiles by [@birchmd]

## [1.6.4] - 2021-09-29

### Changes

- Fix JSON formatting in `ft_metadata` method by [@birchmd].
- Fix a bug in `block.timestamp` (units should be seconds) by [@birchmd].

## [1.6.3] - 2021-09-14

### Changes

- Revert the ERC-20 admin address changes for the time being by [@joshuajbouw].

## [1.6.2] - 2021-09-13

### Changes

- Change the ERC-20 admin address to have a dedicated account by [@sept-en].
- Fix precompile promises that were broken in rust-blockchain/evm by
  [@joshuajbouw] and [@birchmd].
- Fix the return format of `ft_balance_of` by [@joshuajbouw].

### Removed

- Remove Testnet balancing `balance_evm_and_nep141` by [@birchmd].

## [1.6.1] - 2021-08-23

### Breaking changes

- Update the `view` call to correctly return the Borsh serialization of
  `TransactionStatus`. Previously, it returned a string with the result of
  the transaction by name.

- Change the `ft_balance_of` result as previously it returned a non-JSON
  string value `0`. This has been fixed to return `"0"`.

## [1.6.0] - 2021-08-13

### Breaking changes

- Change the transaction status of `submit` as running out of gas,
  funds, or being out-of-the-offset are not fatal errors but failed
  executions.

The `submit` call altered the `SubmitResult` object to the following format:

```rust
enum TransactionStatus {
    Succeed(Vec<u8>),
    Revert(Vec<u8>),
    OutOfGas,
    OutOfFund,
    OutOfOffset,
    CallTooDeep,
}

struct ResultLog {
    topics: Vec<[u8; 32]>,
    data: Vec<u8>,
}

struct SubmitResult {
    status: TransactionStatus, // above
    gas_used: u64,
    logs: Vec<ResultLog>,
}
```
