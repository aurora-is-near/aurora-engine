## [Unreleased]

## [2.5.2] 2022-03-22

### Removed

- New Aurora-only precompiles removed since they do not work in NEAR view calls. This will need to be fixed and they will be re-added to a future release.

## [2.5.1] - 2022-03-16

### Fixes

- Fix for bug in checking address exists introduced in the v2.5.0 release by [@birchmd]. ([#469])

### Added

- New Aurora-only precompiles for checking the current and predecessor NEAR account IDs by [@birchmd]. ([#462])

[#469]: https://github.com/aurora-is-near/aurora-engine/pull/469

## [2.5.0] - 2022-03-09

### Changes

- Performance improvement by [@birchmd] and [@olonho]: ([#455]) ([#456])

### Fixes

- Bug fix for the behaviour of transactions to the zero address by [@birchmd]. ([#458])

[#458]: https://github.com/aurora-is-near/aurora-engine/pull/458

## [2.4.0] - 2022-02-16

### Changes

- Performance improvements by [@birchmd] and [@matklad]; the engine should now consume much less NEAR gas: ([#427]) ([#438]) ([#439]) ([#445]) ([#446])
- Security improvment: only Engine contract owner can use the `deploy_upgrade` method by [@birchmd]. ([#410])
- Bug fix: Engine now returns the error message in the case of a revert during an EVM contract deploy, previously it would always return an address (even when the deploy failed) by [@birchmd]. ([#424])
- Security improvment: Engine will no longer accept EVM transactions without a chain ID as part of their signature by [@birchmd]. This should have no impact on users as all modern Ethereum tooling includes the chain ID. ([#432])
- Improvements to code quality by [@mrLSD]: ([#386]) ([#387])
- Improvements and additions to internal tests and benchmarks by [@birchmd]: ([#408]) ([#415]) ([#429])

## [2.3.0] - 2021-12-10

### Added

- A precompile which exposes NEAR's random number generator was added by [@mfornet] as requested by 
[@birchmd]. ([#368] [#297])
- London hard fork support was added by [@birchmd]. ([#244])

### Changes

- The gas limit for `deposit` and `ft_on_transfer` were changed as they were not attaching enough
gas, as changed by [@mrLSD]. ([#389])

### Fixes

- There was an issue with the original storage not actually being stored. Unfortunately, previous 
transactions can't be updated with this change. This has been fixed by [@birchmd]. ([#390])
- Call arguments were intended to have a value attached to them to make it equivalent to an ETH
call. This was fixed in a backwards compatible manner by [@andrcmdr], as reported by [@birchmd].
([#351] [#309])

### Removed

- Betanet support was dropped and will no longer be supported by [@joshuajbouw]. ([#388])

## [2.2.0] - 2021-11-09

### Added

- Depositing ETH from Ethereum to Aurora now allows an `0x` prefix on the recipient address by [@joshuajbouw]. ([#337](https://github.com/aurora-is-near/aurora-engine/pull/337))

## [2.1.0] - 2021-11-04

### Fixed

- Bug in `ft_transfer_call` and `ft_resolve_transfer` by  [@birchmd] and [@mrLSD]. ([#326](https://github.com/aurora-is-near/aurora-engine/pull/326) [#330](https://github.com/aurora-is-near/aurora-engine/pull/330))
- Incorrect gas cost on ripemd precompile by [@joshuajbouw]. ([#329](https://github.com/aurora-is-near/aurora-engine/pull/329))

## [2.0.2] - 2021-11-01

### Added

- Logging number of storage writes by [@birchmd]. ([#322](https://github.com/aurora-is-near/aurora-engine/pull/322))

### Fixed

- Show full address in logging transaction sender on `submit` by [@birchmd]. ([#321](https://github.com/aurora-is-near/aurora-engine/pull/321))

## [2.0.1] - 2021-11-01

### Added

- Added logging of public keys during `submit` calls by [@joshuajbouw]. ([#319](https://github.com/aurora-is-near/aurora-engine/pull/319))

## [2.0.0] - 2021-10-27

### Added

- Public method for computing Aurora blockhash at a given hight by [@birchmd]. ([#303](https://github.com/aurora-is-near/aurora-engine/pull/303))

### Changed

- EVM logs returned in `SubmitResult` include the address the log originates from by [@birchmd]. ([#299](https://github.com/aurora-is-near/aurora-engine/pull/299))
  - Note: this is a breaking change in the `SubmitResult` binary format.

### Fixed

- Precompile bug fixes by [@birchmd]. ([#305](https://github.com/aurora-is-near/aurora-engine/pull/305), [#306](https://github.com/aurora-is-near/aurora-engine/pull/306))
- Update to latest `rust-blockchain/evm` version (fixes bug in `JUMPI`) EVM opcode by [@birchmd]. ([#316](https://github.com/aurora-is-near/aurora-engine/pull/316))

## [1.7.0] - 2021-10-13

### Changes

- Add EVM events for exit precompiles by [@birchmd]

## [1.6.4] - 2021-09-29

### Changes

- Fix JSON formatting in `ft_metadata` method by [@birchmd].
- Fix a bug in `block.timestamp` (units should be seconds) by [@birchmd].

## [1.6.3] - 2021-09-14

### Changes

- Revert the ERC-20 admin address changes for the time being by [@joshuajbouw].

## [1.6.2] - 2021-09-13

### Changes

- Change the ERC-20 admin address to have a dedicated account by [@sept-en].
- Fix precompile promises that were broken in rust-blockchain/evm by
  [@joshuajbouw] and [@birchmd].
- Fix the return format of `ft_balance_of` by [@joshuajbouw].

### Removed

- Remove Testnet balancing `balance_evm_and_nep141` by [@birchmd].

## [1.6.1] - 2021-08-23

### Breaking changes

- Update the `view` call to correctly return the Borsh serialization of
  `TransactionStatus`. Previously, it returned a string with the result of
  the transaction by name.

- Change the `ft_balance_of` result as previously it returned a non-JSON
  string value `0`. This has been fixed to return `"0"`.

## [1.6.0] - 2021-08-13

### Breaking changes

- Change the transaction status of `submit` as running out of gas,
  funds, or being out-of-the-offset are not fatal errors but failed
  executions.

The `submit` call altered the `SubmitResult` object to the following format:

```rust
enum TransactionStatus {
    Succeed(Vec<u8>),
    Revert(Vec<u8>),
    OutOfGas,
    OutOfFund,
    OutOfOffset,
    CallTooDeep,
}

struct ResultLog {
    topics: Vec<[u8; 32]>,
    data: Vec<u8>,
}

struct SubmitResult {
    status: TransactionStatus, // above
    gas_used: u64,
    logs: Vec<ResultLog>,
}
```
