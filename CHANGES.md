## [Unreleased]

## [1.6.3] - 2021-09-14

### Changes

- Revert ERC20 admin address changes for the time being by [@joshuajbouw].

## [1.6.2] - 2021-09-13

### Changes

- ERC20 admin address has been changed to have a dedicated account by [@sept-en].
- Precompile promises were fixed that were broken in rust-blockchain/evm by [@joshuajbouw] and [@birchmd].
- Return format of `ft_balance_of` was fixed by [@joshuajbouw].

### Removed

- Testnet balancing `balance_evm_and_nep141` has been removed by [@birchmd].

## [1.6.1] - 2021-08-23

### Breaking changes

- The `view` call has been correctly updated to return the Borsh
  serialization of `TransactionStatus`. Previously, it was returning a
  string with the result of the transaction by name.

- The `ft_balance_of` result was changed as previously it was returning a
  non-JSON string value `0`. This has been fixed to return `"0"`.

## [1.6.0] - 2021-08-13

### Breaking changes

- The transaction status of `submit` was changed as running out of gas,
  funds, or being out-of-the-offset are not fatal errors but failed
  executions.

The `submit` call altered the `SubmitResult` object to the following format:

```rust
enum TransactionStatus {
    Succeed(Vec<u8>),
    Revert(Vec<u8>),
    OutOfGas,
    OutOfFund,
    OutOfOffset,
    CallTooDeep,
}

struct ResultLog {
    topics: Vec<[u8; 32]>,
    data: Vec<u8>,
}

struct SubmitResult {
    status: TransactionStatus, // above
    gas_used: u64,
    logs: Vec<ResultLog>,
}
```
